        <p>I willdearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones
            have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a
            awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and
            work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow
            by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will
            dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him.

                <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I"ve written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work. </p>
